### HERE ARE ALL THE NOTES TAKEN FROM THE GOOGLE MACHINE LEARNING CRASH COURSE THAT YOU CAN FIND [here](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course)

The ML changes how you write an algorithm, it changes the common way to write a long code, to just write a simpler code with lots of examples

[Framing](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/framing/ml-terminology)
Supervised Machine Learning:

-   The ML system learn how to combine an input and produce useful predictions on newer datas
-   We use **labels**, where labels are the variables that we want to predict (represented by _y_)
-   We also use **features**, where features are the variables that describes our data (represented by _x_{x1, x2, x3...})
-   A **model** is examples to predic labels

## Regression vs Classification

-   In regression, the ml model will predict continuous values like (0, 100, 200, 10000, ...)
-   In classification, the ml model will predict concrete data, like (dog, paper, true or false, ...)

-   Lots of complex ways to learn from data
